The robotics community has made impressive progress in recentyears.
Reliable and in-expensive robot hardware—from land-based mobile robots, 
to quadrotor helicopters, tohumanoids—is more widely available than ever before. 
Perhaps even more impressively,the community has also developed algorithms that help those robots run with increasinglevels of autonomy.
In spite of (or, some might argue, because of) this rapid progress, robots do still presentsome significant challenges for software developers. 
This book introduces a software plat-form calledRobot Operating System, 
orROS,1that is intended to ease some of these dif-ficulties. 
The official description of ROS is:ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot.
It provides theservices you would expect from an operating system, including hardware ab-straction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used func-tionality, 
message-passing between processes, and packagemanagement.  
It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building,writing, 
and runningcode across multiple computers.
